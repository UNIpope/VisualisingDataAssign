# Visualising Data Assignment
*.ipynb are viewable on Github*
1. Select 2 or more datasets.
2. Merge, Wrangle and Explore the datasets.
3. Form Big Idea (What the visualisations will show)
4. Graph and visualise data to prove Big Idea.

## Dataset Info
The datasets has two distinct regions, Germany and America. Comparing the differences between
these two may be interesting. Exploring the data lead to some interesting graphs but as both regions
are together not much can be made in the way of conclusions.
Building on this idea, the year, fuel type, distance travelled, and price can be considered to prove
what prompts a regional driver to sell their vehicle online.

## Big Idea
A discovery into what makes US and German car drivers want to sell
their beloved vehicles using online marketplace data!

2. Merge:
  - Read in and cleanup datasets (ie. German to english)
  - Merge datasheets
  - write to new file
  
3. Exploring:
  - Data summarys
  - Plot Data
  - filter by countries (US / Ger)
  
4. Form Big Idea based of explorations.
5. Use Visualisations to prove big Idea
